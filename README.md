###A web icon font with style
525icons is a very comprehensive and versatile web icon collection, designed for websites and apps, and it is completely free for commercial use. 

Most of the icons are designed, customized and vectorized "by hand" in Adobe Illustrator before the processing into a font.
A few are directly copied from the different open source icon packs that are available online, 
among them the "IcoMoon - Free" pack and the "Font Awesome" icon collection. Some are known brand logos, 
vectorized from png format or copied from open source svg files found on the net. 

The font is assembled in the icoMoon app: https://icomoon.io/app.

The css code is adapted from the Font Awesome css-toolkit by Dave Gandy.
